# 🧠 Neural Network From Scratch in NumPy

This project implements a fully-functional neural network from scratch using only **NumPy**—no external ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

It classifies **handwritten digit images** (0–9) and was trained on a custom dataset. The network uses a two-layer architecture with:
- Hidden Layer: 64 neurons (Sigmoid activation)
- Output Layer: 10 neurons (Softmax activation)
